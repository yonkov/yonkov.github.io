      <description>Shepherd.js is an awesome library for creating interactive user walktroughs / client onboarding. With Shepherd, you can create an intro tour to guide the visitor through a list of steps. Each step can trigger different optional actions. For example, the user can go back a step or go to the next step, dismiss the tour without reaching the end of it or close the tour after completion. All the hard work is done for us, and we only need to write a few lines of javaScript to set it up.</description>

Let me tell you why. When the user visits a web page for a first time, he probably arrived there because he was searching for something in the first place and he might or might not figure out where to look for it.</description>
