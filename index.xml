      <description>In the WordPress admin, when you edit a post or page for the first time, a guided tour pops up and introduces the user to the Gutenberg editor. Traditionally, WordPress was using a visual editor (also known as the Classic Editor to create posts and pages without the need to write custom html. Since version 5.0, the Gutenberg plugin has been integrated into the WordPress core, replacing the old editor.</description>

      <description>Shepherd.js is an awesome library for creating interactive user walktroughs / client onboarding. With Shepherd, you can create an intro tour to guide the visitor through a list of steps. Each step can trigger different optional actions. For example, the user can go back a step or go to the next step, dismiss the tour without reaching the end of it or close the tour after completion. All the hard work is done for us, and we only need to write a few lines of javaScript to set it up.</description>

      <description>Why is User Onboarding Important? Guided tours matter. In fact, if you are still not using interactive user introductions to guide users throughout your app&amp;rsquo;s content, you should probably start doing that as soon as possible. Let me tell you why. When the user visits a web page for a first time, he probably arrived there because he was searching for something in the first place and he might or might not figure out where to look for it.</description>

      <description>Dark mode is one of the newest and hottest trends in web development. Since release of macOS 10.14 in September 2018, more and more apps are starting to offer the option for users to choose a dark system-wide interface over the standard light color scheme. Recent versions of Windows 10 and Android also started to offer dark mode layout. It is perceived that a dark background is much more easier on the eyes and attracts more readers, especially during night time.</description>

 More and More web apps are offering or considering to offer a &amp;ldquo;dark mode&amp;rdquo; layout to their visitors that comes together with their normal, &amp;ldquo;light mode&amp;rdquo; layout.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, you may need to add a section in your page that displays recent blog posts. WordPress homepage by default shows recent blog posts and nothing else. However, in most of the cases, the user would like to customize the homepage content to display other sections as well. In such cases, you can use the Gutenberg editor, the new core WordPress editor, since it has a lot of code blocks that are very handy and easy to use.</description>

      <description>I had a client that needed to build an archive website for a museum. Needless to say, the museum had thousands of materials, seperated into categories and subcategories.

In this tutorial, I will show you two ways how to sort the posts from a certain category archive page like a pro!</description>

In the past, I was using Yuzo Related Posts plugin. However, in the beginning of 2019, there was a vulnerability issue and it is no longer supported by the WordPress community.</description>

      <description>The Divi theme is one of the most versatile WordPress premium themes with tons of options that also comes together with its powerful page builder. However, in some cases, you want to make some customizations and you simply cannot find a quick fix for them. An example for that is the Divi menu animation. The header always shrinks on page dropdown and while some may argue that this gives a modern feel to your Divi website, this transition effect is certainly not for everyone.</description>
